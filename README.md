###### Developed By [Gaurav D. Sharma](http://gauravds.blogspot.in/)

## Install
Place this plugin ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins and then restart Xcode.

(If path not exist then create or better install [Alcatraz](https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz))

Search `SortXcodeSelection` inside **Alcatraz**

If successfully deployed it will show a menu in Xcode->Edit->GDS Sort Selected Area v1.0

## Use
Alphabetically sort headers or pod list or selected text in xcode is pain. Use this plugin for overcome that pain.
It is same work as **vi** uses `sort i` command.

Select text which you want to sort then type **control+\`** (shortcut) or use
`Xcode->Edit->GDS Sort Selected Area v1.0`
